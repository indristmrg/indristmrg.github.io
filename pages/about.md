## **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Fresh graduate that passionate about data management and policy research, equipped with 
strong analytical thinking and writing skills. I have gained practical experience in regulatory 
compliance, fintech operations, and strategic documentation through my role at PT Adhyoka Berkah 
Maju. I have demonstrated the ability to coordinate effectively with financial institutions and contribute 
to the development of high-quality regulatory and business planning documents. I am a resilient and 
adaptable team player with a proven track record of problem-solving in dynamic environments, and I 
am a continuous learner committed to personal and professional growth. I also took a brief academic 
leave due to financial and health reasons, yet remained committed and completed my degree on time in 
8 semesters, demonstrating responsibility and perseverance.
