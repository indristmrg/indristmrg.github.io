The legislative institution is supposed to represent the people, protect their interests, and address societal hardships. Yet, in Indonesia today, the opposite seems true. Instead of creating fair laws through parliamentary discussion, the legislature is often perceived as siding against the public. Recent policies have sparked widespread debates, culminating in large-scale demonstrations on August 25, 2025, at the Indonesian Parliament by students, workers, traders, influencers, activists, and online motorcycle taxi drivers.

By August 29, protests had spread to multiple provinces, including Jambi, Central Kalimantan, Central Java, East Java, West Java, and South Sulawesi. These demonstrations not only oppose controversial parliamentary policies but also reflect public frustration reaching a tipping point.

## A Growing Discontent

Public anger erupted after news surfaced about high parliamentary allowances, deemed disproportionate to the struggles faced by ordinary Indonesians. Many argued that these benefits serve only officials, while citizens struggle with rising unemployment, limited job opportunities, and declining purchasing power. The increase in housing allowances sparked protests on social media platforms like Instagram, X, TikTok, and other media outlets. Instead of providing clear explanations, some parliament members aggravated the situation with unsympathetic and arrogant responses.

For instance, Nafa Urbach (Commission XI member) made comments on traffic congestion that offended many struggling daily commuters. Former comedian Eko Patrio (Deputy Chair of Commission VI) also faced criticism after posting a parody video mocking the protests, intensifying public discontent. Deputy Speaker Adies Kadir sparked outrage by claiming the Rp50 million monthly housing allowance was insufficient, citing daily expenses of Rp3 million for 26 working days, totaling Rp78 million. Meanwhile, Commission III Deputy Chair Ahmad Sahroni stirred controversy by labeling those demanding parliament’s dissolution as “the world’s dumbest mentality,” further fueling public anger.

## Protests and Tragedies

The first mass protest occurred outside the Parliament building on Monday, August 25, 2025, with thousands expressing their grievances. Tensions escalated after an online motorcycle taxi driver, Affan Kurniawan, died under a police tactical vehicle. This tragic incident intensified the protests, which expanded beyond the Parliament to the Brimob Kwitang base.

Citizens, initially voicing frustration over legislative abuses, now demanded the dissolution of parliament and staged protests against both policymakers and authorities deemed unsupportive or neglectful. Public outrage highlights the irony of taxpayer money and privileges being used to silence citizens, underscoring the failure of political institutions to represent, oversee, and protect society.

## The Call for Reform

Despite the anger, dissolving parliament is not a feasible solution. Indonesia follows the principle of Trias Politica, separating executive, legislative, and judicial powers to ensure balance and checks among state institutions. Academics also note that parliament can only be dissolved through constitutional amendments, a power vested in the MPR, composed of both DPR and DPD members. Thus, dissolving parliament faces significant political and legal hurdles.

In response, activists, including Indonesian diaspora member Salsa Erwina Hutagalung, urged parliament and the police to meet public demands within seven days. Their call attracted widespread attention, gaining support from over one million Instagram users and endorsements from domestic influencers.

The demands put forward include the passage of the Asset Confiscation Bill, the dismissal of parliament members who insult citizens, a transparent audit of the Rp9.9 trillion parliamentary budget, and the removal of special privileges that exacerbate social inequality. Citizens also demand the release of arrested protesters, accountability for officers involved in the death of a taxi driver, and the dismissal of the police chief, who is deemed ineffective in protecting the public.

Ongoing demonstrations demonstrate that the people’s voice cannot be silenced. The responsibility now rests with parliament and the police: to respond with real reforms or face escalating public discontent.
