# Book Genre Prediction

**Book Genre Prediction** is a machine learning project where I scraped over 10,000 book entries from Goodreads to classify them into **fiction** or **non-fiction** based on their descriptions. The goal was to explore how natural language processing and classification models can enhance digital library systems and bookstore categorization.

## How it Works

- Scraped book metadata and descriptions using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- Cleaned and tokenized text data using `NLTK`
- Trained multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
- Achieved up to **92% accuracy** on unseen data
- Built a prototype using Streamlit to allow genre prediction based on custom input
