## Executive Summary

This paper examines the resilience of small and micro enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic using panel data from the Micro and Small Industry Survey (VIMK) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) in 2019, 2021, and 2022. By employing firm-level panel regressions based on 2-digit KBLI classifications and size categories, the study identifies key structural and behavioral factors associated with firm performance during the crisis period. The results reveal that digital adoptionâ€”measured by the use of digital marketing and online salesâ€”is a critical driver of resilience for small firms. The study contributes to the growing body of evidence on how digital strategies can buffer SMEs against external economic shocks and support their post-crisis recovery.
